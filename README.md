# Image recognition without convolution

The code in the repository exploit the popular Dogs and Cats dataset to train a deep neural network able to correctly classify my two dogs. The purpouse of the notebook is to show how difficult is to address imagee classification problems without convolutional neural network. In the last part of the project i will be use naive enasble and boosting method to increase the model accuracy.
